##License Plus
###This was forked from the original atom-license package for atom.

I decided to fork the [atom-licence][17f3d1a1] package and include some new and updated licenses since I noticed the github page for the original had not been updated in about a year.  That and I often work with projects that use licenses that weren't available so I decided to add them.

If you want to read the original projects README it's README-ORIG
